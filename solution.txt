1. Jeremy Bowers
2. At first, I was extremely clueless and wasn't so what to do. I just randomly ran some of the code. After reading the hints and clues a few more
times, I realized I was suppose to find the correct Annabel witness. I tried did a look at Annabel Church and found a interview #. I was lucky
enough to find the correct witness at first shot. After, I did a search on the license plate and car model to narrrow down
the suspects. Jeremy Bowers and Joe Germuska fitted the description so far, both at least 6', correct model and license plate.
To finalize everything, I needed to make sure they have all 4 memberships provided in the clues. Museum_of_Bash_History, AAA, Delta_SkyMiles,
and Local Library. Jeremy Bowers fitted the description. I am not so sure if this was correct. So, I tried to look through
the other witnesses as well just in case I was wrong.
